## 2212 Team 2 Project repository

## Synopsis

This repository contains a household management web app that allows the users to easily stay on top of tasks, events, and finances of the household.

##  Repository Organization

To organize the repo we created a branch on master, and called it dev.  When adding a new feature, the person implementing it would
branch off of dev and make their own changes. Once the changes were confirmed to work it was merged back into dev. Once it was ready to 
be evaluated it was branched back into the master.
